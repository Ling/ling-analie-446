Basic Sudoku

To build, extract the archive with
  $ tar xzf ling-analie-sudoku-0.0.1.tar.bz

Then execute

  $ cd ling-analie-sudoku-0.0.1
  $ ./configure && make

You may now run the game with the command
  $ ./src/sudoku

If you do not hae ncurses or equivalent library you may obtain it at
http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-5.7.tar.gz

If you wish to build in windows, please ensure you have a working curses
directory, that you have the path to headers and libraries set, and finally you
link against your curses library.


Some puzzles are included in the levels subdirectory.

The doxygen documents are in the documentation subfolder.
